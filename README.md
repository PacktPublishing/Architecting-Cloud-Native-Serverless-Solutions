**Design, build, and operate serverless solutions on cloud and open source platforms**

## What is this book about?
Serverless computing has emerged as a mainstream paradigm in both cloud and on-premises computing, with AWS Lambda playing a pivotal role in shaping the Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) landscape. However, with the explosion of serverless technologies and vendors, it has become increasingly challenging to comprehend the foundational services and their offerings.
Architecting Cloud Native Serverless Solutions lays a strong foundation for understanding the serverless landscape and technologies in a vendor-agnostic manner. You'll learn how to select the appropriate cloud vendors and technologies based on your specific needs. In addition, you'll dive deep into the serverless services across AWS, GCP, Azure, and Cloudflare followed by open source serverless tools such as Knative, OpenFaaS, and OpenWhisk, along with examples. You'll explore serverless solutions on Kubernetes that can be deployed on both cloud-hosted clusters and on-premises environments, with real-world use cases.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Understand the serverless landscape and its potential
* Build serverless solutions across AWS, Azure, and GCP
* Develop and run serverless applications on Kubernetes
* Implement open source FaaS with Knative, OpenFaaS, and OpenWhisk
* Modernize web architecture with Cloudflare Serverless
